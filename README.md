# Vanilla PHP quick start app 
This repository is just a quick start for any small php application or an interview task :wink: which requires no Framework at all.
As you see it's forked from [here](https://github.com/laracasts/The-PHP-Practitioner-Full-Source-Code) but I made some edits on top of it. 

## Features
    1. Simple routing.
    2. Simple service container.
    3. Simple MVC design pattern.
    4. Applying SOLID for more abstraction.
    
You can easily edit your .env file with your configurations and start building something simple.
